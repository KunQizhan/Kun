    "- The real world is uncertain but we as humans still manage to make decisions every day. Probability and utility theory can help us design artificial systems which can cope with certain types of uncertainty, i.e. MDPs help us deal with fully observable and non-deterministic/stochastic environments. For dealing with partially observable and stochastic cases we make use of the generalization of MDPs named POMDPs (partially observable Markov decision process) which we will not consider in this session.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A stochastic process has the **Markov property** if the conditional probability distribution of future states of the process (conditional on both past and present states) depends only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In our case it is the transitions model which has this property, i.e. the next depends only on the previous one, not the full history e.g. $P(s_{3}|s_2,a)$ and not $P(s_{3}|s_2,s_1,s_0,a)$\n",
