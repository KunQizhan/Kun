DEDUCTION

use in:

Detective work, Law, Math, Medical Diagnosis



Deductive Argument Forms 

Argument Based on Mathematics – conclusion depends on a mathematical computation or measurement 

Argument from Definition – conclusions depend on definitions 

Syllogisms 

– 2 premises and 1 conclusion

 Categorical – (all, no, some) 

Hypothetical – (if, let’s assume)



Words of certainty: Necessarily, certainly, absolutely, definitely



INDUCTION

used in:

Polling， Statistics， Scientists， Medical Treatment



Inductive Argument Forms 

Prediction– uses knowledge of the past to conclude future events 

Argument from Analogy – conclusions depend on similarities between two things. 

A is similar to B 

X is true for A 

X is probably true for B 

Generalization – argument that uses knowledge of a sample and infers truth to the entire population.

Argument Based on Signs – conclusions based on symbols, visual signals (not just text signs).

Causal Inference – argument from knowledge of a cause to a claim about an effect, or, conversely, from knowledge of an effect to a claim about a cause.



Words of probability: Probably, improbable, plausible, implausible, likely, unlikely, and reasonably 



Is an argument inductive or deductive? 

1. Check for indicator words 
2. Evaluate the strength of the inferential link between premises and conclusion
